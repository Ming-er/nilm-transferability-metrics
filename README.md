# Transferability Metrics for NILM

This repository is going to contain the implementation of our transferability metrics, which we define in our latest publication: [On Metrics to Assess the Transferability of Machine
Learning Models in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06200.pdf)

PS: compatible to NILMTK!
